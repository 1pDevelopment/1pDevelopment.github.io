Hi there!

Welcome to the website, and this first post.
So what is this about ?  
I could write a lot of stuff about why I've started this blog, but for now let us focus on the technical _why_.
To learn something new, I decided to rewrite my website in Jekyll and host it on [Github][gh]. The result, is what you're looking at.

Initially, I had a good read [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/), where the basics of setting you up are described.
With an initial scaffold, I kept reading on the official [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com) and acquired a good foundation.

Basically, Jekyll is a static site generator, which renders a website based on templates. I've decided to use the Markdown engine for the the templates. A nice cheat sheet can be found [here][md-cheat]

To conclude it all, I pushed my site to [Github](gh) and the result is what you're looking at.
